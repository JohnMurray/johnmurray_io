title: "Dispousing Myths - Web Services are Easy"
---

Talk about how everyone always advertises that web services are easy
to create and it's only "3 lines of code" to get up and running or how
you can build a blog in 20 minutes (or all kinds of other lies used for
advertising frameworks). 

Talk about all the other stuff that is required to truly build an application
for the enterprise / real-world, including things like:

* monitoring
* instrumentation / metrics
* release process
* production server setup (puppet / chef)
* handling error conditions gracefully
* load balancers / DNS / GSLB
* Databases and DB redundancy
* etc

Focus the article on new graduates or people still in school and those
people in business who may not be super technical and understand all that it
takes to get a service out to production.
