        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starting a Scala Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When starting a new Scala project there are a few things that you want
do get setup correctly before starting your development work. These are
some of the things that I do for each new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler&lt;/strong&gt; - I have created a GitHub repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/basic-scala-template&quot;&gt;basic-scala-template&lt;/a&gt; that 
contains everything that is mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; - Based on feedback, I have listed updates to the template
at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-on-activator&quot;&gt;A Note on Activator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonderful people at Typesafe have a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typesafe.com/activator&quot;&gt;Activator&lt;/a&gt; which
is a nice little tool that, among other things, allows you to get started quickly
by selecting a base template. While this is useful and there are some good
templates, I still prefer to manage my own template. This allows me to make some
additions that are missing from the Activator templates and setup my projects
in a way that work best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sbt&quot;&gt;SBT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I setup all my projects as a standard SBT project (because why wouldn’t you)
so hopefully you can find this useful. The first thing I do is download the
version of SBT that I want and add the launcher and the shell script local
to my git repo. This way I always have sbt available on whatever machine
that I am working on and I am able to make per-project changes to the
launcher. If you do this as well you will have to get used to typing &lt;code&gt;./sbt&lt;/code&gt; 
vs &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;/code&gt;, but that is an easy change to make. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of right now, my project structure looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=layout-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will note that for the actual &lt;code&gt;sbt&lt;/code&gt; script I usually just use one of
my own rather than the super-complex ones that ship with the SBT download. My
current sbt launch script looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=sbt&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-sbt-additions&quot;&gt;Basic SBT Additions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have SBT setup for a project, I can start doing some basic
configurations that I figure I will need on all my projects. First I’m going
to add is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver&quot;&gt;sbt-revolver&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very useful plugin that can run
your project in a forked JVM and reload it on a change. We can add this to
the project by adding the following to our &lt;code&gt;project/plugin.sbt&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=plugins-line-1.sbt&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m at it, I’m going to add one more plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea&quot;&gt;sbt-idea&lt;/a&gt;, that can 
generate IDE-specific files for IntelliJ IDE with a simple command &lt;code&gt;gen-idea&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=plugins-line-2.sbt&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;template-build-file&quot;&gt;Template Build File&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using SBT I opt for the full &lt;code&gt;Build.scala&lt;/code&gt; vs the DSL-like &lt;code&gt;build.sbt&lt;/code&gt; file.
I find it easier and more straight-forward to work with. I like to break my
build file into several logical sections: resolvers, dependencies, build settings,
and the application build. My typical build-file looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=Build.scala&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this build file is pretty bare (&lt;em&gt;at the moment&lt;/em&gt;) there are some key
things that I like to include as part of every build configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Scala&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    Aside from specifying the version that I will be using for this project, I
    also specify some basic compiler options to output more verbose warnings and
    do some extra checks for me.
  &lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;Versioning&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    I like to start each project as a snapshot version (0.0.1). I can then extend
    the build-file later with some publishing configurations to push snapshot versions
    to a repo (like Sonatype) on each successful build/commit/test-run/etc.
  &lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;Revolver&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    Even though we added the &lt;code&gt;sbt-revolver&lt;/code&gt; plugin to our 
    &lt;code&gt;plugins.sbt&lt;/code&gt; file earlier we still need to add the settings to 
    our build to fully install it.
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;style-checking&quot;&gt;Style Checking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this is a new addition but I generally like consistency in my projects (open
source and closed) when it comes to style. I’ve been playing around with various
style checkers, but I’ve settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scalastyle.org/&quot;&gt;Scalastyle&lt;/a&gt; for now. I don’t have much beyond
the standard, but I’m sure it’ll evolve over time. I added the following to my
&lt;code&gt;plugins.sbt&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=plugins-line-3-4.sbt&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also updated our &lt;code&gt;buildSettings&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;project/Build.scala&lt;/code&gt; by appending the
Scalastyle settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=scalastyle-build.scala&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the build configuration goes, my configuration isn’t far off the default you
get by running &lt;code&gt;sbt scalastyle-generate-config&lt;/code&gt; so I won’t list it here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing I typically start with Specs2 and add from there. For this we add to the build
file simply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=Build.specs2.scala&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily add others in the same fashion. For example, if I were doing an Akka
project I would add the &lt;code&gt;akka-testkit&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;spray-teskit&lt;/code&gt; for Spray projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the project I am building is open source, I have to think about CI what build
system I’m going to use. I personally prefer to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; just because
it’s so darn simple. Since this is usually the case I add the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=.travis.yml&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I like to add some basic files that I put in most projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    The baiscs for scala projects as well as IntelliJ project-files and general
    files (like &lt;code&gt;.swp&lt;/code&gt; files and what not)
  &lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    I like to include a readme with all of my projects (open source or not) just
    as a &lt;em&gt;welcome&lt;/em&gt; and a guide for navigating and working with the project.
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;done&quot;&gt;Done!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m done putting together all the pieces to get started, my final directory
structure is laid out in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=layout-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the spoiler up top, I have put this into a git repository for my
own (and possibly your) convenience &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/basic-scala-template&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can start any new project using 
this template simply via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=clone-repo.sh&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can clone the repository and add the &lt;code&gt;scala-new&lt;/code&gt; script to your path which is
located in the root of the project. With this you can simply do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/11116775.js?file=scala-new.sh&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script will take care of updating the repo, creating a directory, and copying
over all the necessary files. Easy peasy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find this useful (and I hope you do) then please fork &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/basic-scala-template&quot;&gt;my repo&lt;/a&gt; and customize
it to suite your needs. Feel free to send pull requests if you think I am missing
something awesome that you feel every Scala project should include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-1&quot;&gt;Update #1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a comment by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/user/predef&quot;&gt;predef&lt;/a&gt; on reddit, I have removed the sbt-launcher jar from
my project along with my custom sbt script in favor of using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras&quot;&gt;sbt-extra&lt;/a&gt; script
and creating a &lt;code&gt;project/build.properties&lt;/code&gt; file. You now must simply use the sbt script
&lt;code&gt;./sbt&lt;/code&gt; and the correct version of SBT will be downloaded for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second suggestion was to remove the &lt;code&gt;sbt-idea&lt;/code&gt; plugin from the project and move it
into my global plugins (that’s a thing?!) which is a fantastic idea. So I have now created
the file &lt;code&gt;~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/intellij.sbt&lt;/code&gt; that contains the &lt;code&gt;addPlugin...&lt;/code&gt; that we used
earlier in the &lt;code&gt;plugins.sbt&lt;/code&gt; file for the &lt;code&gt;sbt-idea&lt;/code&gt; plugin. Now the project can be more
agnostic to what editor is used. Do note that if you still want to use the IntelliJ SBT
plugin that you’ll need to add that to your global plugins as the script/template will not
handle that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scala map() vs map{}</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering the other day what the difference really was, in Scala, between&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=map1.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=map2.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I figured I’d take a look at the map function defined on the List class. I winded up
finding the definition in the &lt;code&gt;TraversableLike&lt;/code&gt; trait as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=map-traversable-like.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s ignore the builder for now since it’s the less important part of this question. We’re
interested in the first set of parameters, &lt;code&gt;f: A =&amp;gt; B&lt;/code&gt;. This seems to be a normal argument
yet we can apply it in two different ways. That got me thinking a little bit and so I decided
to play around a bit to see if I can figure this out anecdotally, before looking up the proper
literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-function-arguments&quot;&gt;Non-Function Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first wanted to try with some simple functions that didn’t have functions as arguments to see if
this format is generally applicable. I came up with some simple tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=normal-function.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from this it seems to indicate that braces are not interchangeable with parenthesis. However,
it does seem that &lt;code&gt;&quot;John&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{&quot;John&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; are interchangeable. In fact, if we look at the REPL
we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=braces-repl.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be a surprise to some, but that means that something like &lt;code&gt;echo {&quot;hello&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; can
really just be thought of as a shorthand for &lt;code&gt;echo({&quot;hello&quot;})&lt;/code&gt;. But what about &lt;code&gt;{x =&amp;gt; x * x}&lt;/code&gt;.
We can assume that just returns a function, correct? So that would means we can assume that
these are functionally equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=map3.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, anecdotally, this seems to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-functions&quot;&gt;Back to Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So based on our findings, what is the point of the curly braces and when would they be useful.
Let’s do some experiments with a little more meat and see if we can find an answer. First let’s try
a slightly larger map example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=map4.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah ha, so there is a good reason to use curly braces. It looks like the parenthesis version cannot
handle multiple statements and is only expecting a single expression. Furthermore, I found this bit
interesting as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/7518029.js?file=func-val.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same syntax using parenthesis cannot be used to define the function outside of the map unlike
the version with curly-braces. Very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-real-story&quot;&gt;The Real Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, at this point I feel like I’ve made some interesting findings, but I’m curious what the
Internet has to say about such things. So I figured I’d let her weigh in. I came across a few
different posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/2593&quot;&gt;Scala Forums Posting, complete with appearance by Odersky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4386127/what-is-the-formal-difference-in-scala-between-braces-and-parentheses-and-when&quot;&gt;This SO Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/10195&quot;&gt;Another Scala Forums Posting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, all three answers were by the same person. For someone strapped for time when it
comes to blogging, he sure does seem to make a lot of appearances on this topic. ;-D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there seems to be quite a bit of discussion with some grey areas still that I still
don’t fully understand. In those cases the compiler seems to be the specification, which is never
preferable (IMO) for many reasons. Oh Scala, you are an interesting little language.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Read Less HN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down. What type of content do you typically read on HN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People having great success with their startup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People failing (again) at their Nth startup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wonderful new language that you should learn &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How language X is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better than language Y and why you should 
rewrite all of your existing, working code immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wonderful new framework that you should also learn immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How X technology product is terrible and made some company go out of business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you are starting to get the picture. There are a lot of success stories, a lot
of failure stories, a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of articles/links about some newfangled technology, and even
more articles about how that new technology is better than what you’re currently using in
every way possible. I propose that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of this information is actually doing more
harm than good and that you should attempt to read less HN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loss-in-productivity&quot;&gt;Loss in Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not just talking about the time you spend at work reading HN. HN is a very easy
way to sink hours of time and get relatively little reward. After you’ve read about the
20 new frameworks that came out this week, what are you going to do with that knowledge?
Are you going to try each one? Likely the answer is no. If you are at work or working on
a personal project for fun, likely you have already chosen your set of tools and you are
just wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tend to read more of the “startup stories” on HN, what do you really gain? Will reading
more and more stories about failed and successful startups really teach you everything that
you need to know about running your own startup? And at what point do you start getting
diminishing returns? What is the opportunity cost associated with spending your time reading
100’s of “startup stories” each week/month?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-many-good-things&quot;&gt;Too Many Good Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a fair number of posts on HN detailing the wonderful success that X random startup /
company has had. Reading too many of these articles may get you feeling depressed about your
own situation. Even if you are running a mildly successful business, you’ll still start
to see how your company is failing in one way or another. I’m not saying that is a bad thing,
but I think it would be more beneficial for your company, and for you as a person, to focus
on the things you do well and try to do them even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-many-bad-things&quot;&gt;Too Many Bad Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The converse of the previous point is that there are a ton of posts detailing the massive
failures in their startup or career that have costs them dearly. Those articles, in and of
themselves, are not a bad thing. It is good to know some of the common pitfalls that you 
may face. However, reading too many of these articles may get some people discouraged when
they should not be. When you read a bunch of these type of articles, you have to ask yourself
what you are getting out of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-middle-ground&quot;&gt;No Middle Ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason with the two previous points may just be that there is no strong middle-ground
representation. People seem to talk more about how things went wonderful or horrible.
Likely because that attracts more readership, but it is to the detriment to everyone as
a whole. It also breeds a culture that only wants to talk about the extremes or will exaggerate
the truth to meet those standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-add&quot;&gt;Technology ADD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re more on the engineering side, and anything like me, you like to get your hands dirty
in just about everything tech related. Personally, I can’t get enough of it. However, there is
a point where you want to put a hold on learning every new-fangled language/framework and start
applying your knowledge to build something that you enjoy. However, if you keep subjecting
yourself to the continual stream of technology news, you may have a hard time keeping yourself
focused (How can you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; learn each new “LISP of the month”?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, by digging into less technologies you’ll come to master the ones that you
already know which can be a powerful thing. Many people seem to value the polyglot programmer
these days, but you have to determine how far down that path you’d like to go and how much
mastery you’d like to attain in those languages/tools/frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is not to read absolutely no news at all. Obviously this post was titled “Read
Less HN”, so that’s not where I’m going with all of this. I’d recommend that you switch to
some sort of aggregated format. Something that can curate the top posts and send them to you
on a schedule. Personally, I subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackernewsletter.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for a weekly update. The
idea of curated content has several benefits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best content is filtered for you, so you spend less time reading uninteresting articles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You save time reading a newsletter once a week vs reading the site every day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because you read less articles, you’ll avoid hearing about 20 new frameworks a week and ideally
read about 1’ish which will hopefully be more worthwhile (since it was theoretically filtered
from the initial 20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonderful part about aggregated content is that you have options. If Hacker Newsletter doesn’t
suite you, you could try several other newsletters as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptweekly.com/&quot;&gt;Javascript Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyweekly.com/&quot;&gt;Ruby Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pycoders.com/&quot;&gt;PyCoders Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://statuscode.org/&quot;&gt;Status Code (General CompSci Weekly News)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dartweekly.com/&quot;&gt;Dart Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://html5weekly.com/&quot;&gt;HTML 5 Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hndigest.com/&quot;&gt;HN Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iosdevweekly.com/issues&quot;&gt;iOS Dev Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://androidweekly.net&quot;&gt;Android Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jobety.com/&quot;&gt;Jobety Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also consume multiple newsletters if you’d like but be very careful not to fall back
into the same trap as with HN. Choose carefully and always think about how you’re benefiting
from each article that you read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scala By Example</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that the best way to learn a new language or technology, or anything for that
matter, is to really get your hands dirty. This is especially true when it comes to learning
a new programming language. You really absorb the details of the language by writing code
and small/toy applications in that language. However, just getting started can be a little
hard sometimes. In part because you can’t yet get your hands dirty until you’ve spent a fair
amount of time reading and understanding the basic principals of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I taught an introductory Scala course to my team at AppNexus and I spent a fair amount
of time thinking about how I could get everyone involved while still learning the beginner concepts.
Scala makes this relatively easy by the use of Worksheets. Worksheets are an IDE feature that
allows you to execute a file’s worth of code in a REPL like environment. That being the case, I
created my lessons as a series of worksheets. I walked through each of these explaining various
concepts and answering questions while everyone else was able to immediately start playing with
Scala code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope, and feel, that this was a useful tool. That being said, if you would like to do something
similar with your team, or for yourself, then you can access the worksheets on GitHub. If you find
this useful, please contribute back to the project and socialize it to other developers you know who
might be interested in learning Scala or teaching it to their engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github Repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/learn-scala-worksheets&quot;&gt;https://github.com/JohnMurray/learn-scala-worksheets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Started with Akka</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://akka.io&quot;&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scala-lang.org&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; library for implementing the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model&quot;&gt;Actor Model&lt;/a&gt;. Technically you can use Java as well, but things are a little
more concise and idiomatic in Scala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started shall we. The first thing you should have installed is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.12.4/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html&quot;&gt;sbt&lt;/a&gt;.
Then you’ll want to create a new folder for your project &lt;code&gt;hello-akka&lt;/code&gt;. Within that
folder, let’s create a &lt;code&gt;build.sbt&lt;/code&gt; file with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- build.sbt gist --&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=build.sbt&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that we just have some basic setup with names and versions. You’ll also
notice that we’re delcaring &lt;code&gt;akka-actor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;akka-kernel&lt;/code&gt; as our dependencies. The
main library is &lt;code&gt;akka-actor&lt;/code&gt; which we will (obviously) define our actor in. The second
is a little less obvious, &lt;code&gt;akka-kernel&lt;/code&gt;, and will be used to define our akka-instance
as a standalone setup (not as a library within another project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing we want to do is create a couple of actors to perform an asynchronous
hello-world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=HelloWorldActor.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=Greeter.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note that these files were created within the directory &lt;code&gt;src/main/scala&lt;/code&gt; within
the &lt;code&gt;hello-akka&lt;/code&gt; directory. From the above, you’ll notice that the HelloWorldActor
receives a &lt;code&gt;Tick&lt;/code&gt; event and then sends a message to the &lt;code&gt;Greeter&lt;/code&gt; actor which then
prints &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. You may be wondering what is sending the &lt;code&gt;Tick&lt;/code&gt; event to the
HelloWorldActor to start with. For this we have to define our kernel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=HelloWorldKernel.scala&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the entry-point for our application. You can see that we are creating an instance
of the &lt;code&gt;HelloWorldActor&lt;/code&gt; and scheduling a message be sent (&lt;code&gt;Tick&lt;/code&gt;) every 500 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;done&quot;&gt;Done!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to creating a standalone Akka, pretty simple. There are various ways you
can run your application, but I feel the easiest is with scripts that ship with Akka. To add
that to your project, run the following script from within the &lt;code&gt;hello-akka&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=run.sh&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically create a Makefile for running my project just because I find that easier. You could
do something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=Makefile&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then just run &lt;code&gt;make run&lt;/code&gt; to start your project. You should see something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=akka-output&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        <title>SSH FS Script</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to my employer’s server-configuration, I find myself developing
on remote machines often. However, I find it a pain to setup a dev
environment on every new machine. So, I usually just end up working
local as much as possible via SSH-FS. For anyone else that had to
do this as well, here is a handly little script that will hopefully
help you out (just a little).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Copy to Learn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I have stated my opinion in the past that you should think twice before
creating another web framework, it can be a useful tool. In particular, if you
are familiar with a web framework in your language of choice, it may be a
good learning exercise to try and implement that framework in another
language. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; however that you should likely not try to get people to use
your new framework if it is only for learning purposes. If you are seriously
considering creating a new web framework, please read my post &lt;a href=&quot;/log/2012/04/19/New-Web-Frameworks.md&quot;&gt;New Web
Frameworks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently (as of the time this post was written) taken a new position in
AdTech doing PHP for the purpose of web services. I really don’t know too much
about PHP and it’s been a while since I’ve last encountered real PHP code. So,
I figured that a little homework was in order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that the best way to learn would be to create a fun project in PHP
that could utilize many of PHP’s newer features. For this, I wanted to create
a (very) simple clone of my favorite web-app framework, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinatrarb.com&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the main goal is to better learn PHP’s main language features, but
let’s talk more about what the goal of the project will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement basic Sinatra/HTTP routing methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide pre and post hooks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement parameratized routes in Sinatra fashion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use lambdas to provide an &lt;em&gt;authentic&lt;/em&gt; Sinatra-experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use PHP 5.4 features (where possible/applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a framework called Pinatra (to make it even more obvious my
intent) that is available on my Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/pinatra&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see how well I did
at meeting the aforementioned goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-routing&quot;&gt;Basic Routing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was relatively simple. To get started, I created a main class &lt;code&gt;Pinatra&lt;/code&gt;
that I could use to register my routes with. I then created methods for each
HTTP verb I would be supporting (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that took a path (a
string) and a handler. The handler would then be called if the incoming
request could be matched against the route. The method for registering a GET
request looked generally like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=pinatra_get.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are simply taking the route to match (the &lt;code&gt;$match&lt;/code&gt;) and a
callback (a callable) and sending that on to the &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; function. So, to
look at the register function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=pinatra_register.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see here that we are extracting a regex out of the given match (we’ll
look more at that later) and we are registering the route in a local hash based
on the HTTP verb (&lt;code&gt;$method&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use this very simply now as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=get.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very similar, we can register POST method like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=post.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prepost-hooks&quot;&gt;Pre/Post Hooks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same functionality used to register the routes on a particular HTTP
verb, we can also register before and after hooks. When we create them in our
application, it is as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=before.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=after.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parameratized-routes&quot;&gt;Parameratized Routes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a way of representing data in a given route that is extracted
automatically. For example, given the following route:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/authors/:author_id/books/:book_id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be able to extract the two values, &lt;code&gt;:author_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:book_id&lt;/code&gt;.
Earlier you saw a method for building up the regular expression. This is
what we’ll use to create our route and the match-patterns will be used
to extract the route-data. The method for generating our regex from the
user-supplied route is seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=pinatra_regex.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how the match patterns could be used to extract data from
the URI. This can then be passed to the route-methods. An example of how
this would look is as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=get_with_data.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also notice a JSON helper function (I’ll leave that one for your own
exploration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lambdas&quot;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve already seen the use of lambdas (anonymous functions) in my examples
so far, so suffice it to say, I met that goal. One important thing to note is
that newer versions of PHP provide easy way to rebind anonymous methods making
it possible to use them here. Take a look at the method that actually matches
a request to a route and calls a lambda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/5139047.js?file=handle_request.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;php-54-usage&quot;&gt;PHP 5.4 Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several features were used, but the main new 5.4’ish feature that got used
was traits. They were fun, but I probably used them wrong. Anyways, I’ll leave it
up to you to check out my usage, however I will say that I mainly used them
as modules and not so much as re-usable traits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-learned&quot;&gt;What Was Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I already knew that a PHP script ran every time a new request was made,
I learned that PHP may not be the best language in which to implement a
Sinatra-like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we must register all of the routes on every
request. Since we cannot cache these results, we end up doing a lot of parsing
and string manipulation on every request. This means that as you add new routes,
you incur overhead on every new request, even if that route is never called.
This is unlike other languages in which the application starts up once and then
those computed routes (regex’s) can be cached and re-used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-notes&quot;&gt;Final Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I had mentioned previously, this project was to learn. That being said, there
is probably a lot of debug code and comments left in this project and I would not
recommend it for real-world use. So, if you do want to play around with it, you might
have to remove some &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;var_dump&lt;/code&gt; statements that might still be hanging
around in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Metric K-Center [A]</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my classes are over and the results are in. I’ve implemented a solution
to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center&quot;&gt;Metric k-center&lt;/a&gt; problem and, to be honest, the results are not all
that interesting. But, I’ll go ahead and answer the questions that I proposed
in my last post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-will-the-solution-look-like&quot;&gt;What will the solution look like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was composed of two parts, the runner and the viewer. Its
important to solve the problem (obviously) it is also important to visualize
you’re results. While it is easy to calculate metrics on how much your
algorithm improves over a random solution, it’s hard to see where improvements
can be made (or how they could be made). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runner is targetted for JRuby and solves the application in parallel by
solving for the various values of &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;. The output is then persisted to a MySQL
database so that the logs can later be analyzed and rendered (by the viewer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viewer is just a simple Sinatra app that queries the DB for the latest runs
and allows you to pick out a specific generation for a particular run and value
of &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; and the results are rendered using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://raphaeljs.com/&quot;&gt;Raphael JS&lt;/a&gt; library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-approaches-will-be-best-utilized-for-solvingestimating-the-problem&quot;&gt;What approaches will be best utilized for solving/estimating the problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By approaches I don’t mean frameworks or technologies, I am more referring to
algorithms. For this, I chose to use a couple of different approaches and
combine them together. The first is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm&quot;&gt;genetic algorithmm&lt;/a&gt; (GA) and the 
second is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds&quot;&gt;Wisdom of the Crowd&lt;/a&gt; (WoC). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GA allows me to derive
solutions rather quickly from an initial, random set of solutions (read
up on the Wikipedia article if you need more information on GAs) but, like all
solutions to NP-C problems it is merely an estimation to the solution. WoC allows us
generate a consensus from the set of &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt; (top performing members) of a
given population of solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two approaches will be the main driving factor for our runner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-fast-is-it-because-all-we-care-about-is-speed&quot;&gt;How fast is it? (because all we care about is speed)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t have exact metrics, it takes about 32 seconds to solve a
problem for 100 nodes for 80 value of &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; and 500 evolutions. That’s running
on my home desktop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while I don’t have exact metrics I can talk a little bit about JRuby
versus MRI Ruby. My choice to go with JRuby is two-fold. The first reason
is that I get the benefit of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;-threading. By this I mean that there is
no GIL and when I run multiple threads, I get the benefit of JVM threads
(running on multiple cores). This means that I can use libraries like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://peach.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;. The second is faster overall runtime of the runner (regardless
of whether or not threads are used). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these computations can be ran in parallel and since I have a quad-core
machine, it only makes sense to run the tasks in parallel across multiple cores.
However, if you’re a Rubyist, then you should be more than familiar with the
limitations that come along with the GIL. From this, we can see why JRuby, in
this circumstance, is a much better choice than the current MRI release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-makes-my-solution-better-than-other-existing-solutions&quot;&gt;What makes my solution better than other existing solutions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really. There’s not much novel about my solution, but it was fun and
I did suffice to learn quite a bit. I’ve posted the code (for anyone interested)
on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnMurray/metric-k-center&quot;&gt;JohnMurray/metric-k-center.git&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also added a writeup
of the project (PDF) that is included in the repository if you’re inclined
to know a little more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
