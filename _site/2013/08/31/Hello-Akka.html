  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For those not familiar, <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a> is a <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> library for implementing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor Model</a>. Technically you can use Java as well, but things are a little
more concise and idiomatic in Scala.</p>

<p>Let’s get started shall we. The first thing you should have installed is <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.12.4/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html">sbt</a>.
Then you’ll want to create a new folder for your project <code>hello-akka</code>. Within that
folder, let’s create a <code>build.sbt</code> file with the following contents:</p>

<!-- build.sbt gist -->
<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=build.sbt"></script>

<p>You can see that we just have some basic setup with names and versions. You’ll also
notice that we’re delcaring <code>akka-actor</code> and <code>akka-kernel</code> as our dependencies. The
main library is <code>akka-actor</code> which we will (obviously) define our actor in. The second
is a little less obvious, <code>akka-kernel</code>, and will be used to define our akka-instance
as a standalone setup (not as a library within another project).</p>

<p>The next thing we want to do is create a couple of actors to perform an asynchronous
hello-world:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=HelloWorldActor.scala"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=Greeter.scala"></script>

<p>Take note that these files were created within the directory <code>src/main/scala</code> within
the <code>hello-akka</code> directory. From the above, you’ll notice that the HelloWorldActor
receives a <code>Tick</code> event and then sends a message to the <code>Greeter</code> actor which then
prints <code>"Hello, World"</code>. You may be wondering what is sending the <code>Tick</code> event to the
HelloWorldActor to start with. For this we have to define our kernel:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=HelloWorldKernel.scala"></script>

<p>This is the entry-point for our application. You can see that we are creating an instance
of the <code>HelloWorldActor</code> and scheduling a message be sent (<code>Tick</code>) every 500 milliseconds.</p>

<h2 id="done">Done!</h2>

<p>That’s all there is to creating a standalone Akka, pretty simple. There are various ways you
can run your application, but I feel the easiest is with scripts that ship with Akka. To add
that to your project, run the following script from within the <code>hello-akka</code> directory:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=run.sh"></script>

<p>I typically create a Makefile for running my project just because I find that easier. You could
do something like the following:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=Makefile"></script>

<p>And then just run <code>make run</code> to start your project. You should see something like the following:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/JohnMurray/6400829.js?file=akka-output"></script>
