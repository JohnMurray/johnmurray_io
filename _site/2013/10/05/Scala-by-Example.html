    <p>I believe that the best way to learn a new language or technology, or anything for that
matter, is to really get your hands dirty. This is especially true when it comes to learning
a new programming language. You really absorb the details of the language by writing code
and small/toy applications in that language. However, just getting started can be a little
hard sometimes. In part because you can’t yet get your hands dirty until you’ve spent a fair
amount of time reading and understanding the basic principals of the language.</p>

<p>Recently I taught an introductory Scala course to my team at AppNexus and I spent a fair amount
of time thinking about how I could get everyone involved while still learning the beginner concepts.
Scala makes this relatively easy by the use of Worksheets. Worksheets are an IDE feature that
allows you to execute a file’s worth of code in a REPL like environment. That being the case, I
created my lessons as a series of worksheets. I walked through each of these explaining various
concepts and answering questions while everyone else was able to immediately start playing with
Scala code.</p>

<p>I hope, and feel, that this was a useful tool. That being said, if you would like to do something
similar with your team, or for yourself, then you can access the worksheets on GitHub. If you find
this useful, please contribute back to the project and socialize it to other developers you know who
might be interested in learning Scala or teaching it to their engineering team.</p>
