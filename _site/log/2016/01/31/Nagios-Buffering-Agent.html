        <p>Monitoring and alerting can be a very difficult thing to get right, and many of us
don’t. I’ve been wondering how I can improve systems at my current work when I came
up with a simple way to get some minor improvements in our application alerting that
I thought might be meaningful to share.</p>

<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<p>At my current place of employment we make use of Nagios to perform checks and manage
alerts, a very common setup for many companies. However we have thousands of machines,
hundreds of applications, and a few hundred engineers all of which, for us, imply at
least two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applications have moved heavily toward passive checks to reduce the amount of
Nagios infrastructure require to keep up with active checks</li>
  <li>Each application and/or team handles alerting in a different way, most resulting
in noisy applications that generate many false alarms</li>
</ul>

<p>With those conditions, being on pager has the potential to be a nightmare. A week or
two of no sleep will get you thinking about how you can reduce pager noise, and quickly.
In general most of our pain was around</p>

<ol>
  <li>Transient pages - alerts once and then goes green</li>
  <li>Passive checks that do not clear (only alert on error)</li>
  <li>Unneeded / duplicate checks. Flooding Nagios with errors when something bad happens or
flooding Nagios with OK checks.</li>
</ol>

<p>The general thinking went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I could just improve existing patterns around alerting. However, that’s 15+ applications
to mess with. <strong>Nope, not fast.</strong></p>

  <p>Hrm… I could switch to using metrics-based alerting. There <em>is</em> some work happening there
within my company. <strong>Nope, still not fast.</strong></p>

  <p>I wonder if there is a way to implement some best-practice patterns <em>outside</em> of the
application that is applicable to a variety of app types? <strong>Yes, this sounds faster.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>

<p>Going with the idea of “implementing some alerting best practices <em>oustide</em> of the application”,
I came up with <a href="https://github.com/JohnMurray/nbad.git">NBAd</a> (Nagios Buffering Agent <sub style="font-size:12px;">daemon</sub>).
NBAd runs alongside your application on the same machine and impersonates the Nagios NSCA
interface. Under the covers the application will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buffer incoming messages and keep a cache of last-seen messages, flushing to nagios
on some interval</li>
  <li>Proxy messages that represent a change in state from the last-seen messages (if still
within the cache window)</li>
  <li>Automatically clear error conditions after the message expires from the cache (receiving
constant alerts will keep this value from clearing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the application mimics the NSCA interface, integrating this with your application simply
means pointing your NSCA configs to use <code>localhost:5667</code> as the remote server. This effectively
makes NBAd a drop-in solution that doesn’t require code changes to utilize. Now I can slightly
improve alerting across all my applications with a simple update to the puppet recipes (to
install NBAd) and an application config change.</p>
