    <article class="post-content">
        <p>We’re all familiar with Google’s <em>20%</em>. The developers’ dream of spending company time on personally
interesting projects. Every developer seems to desire this, but very few companies are truly offering
it. I’m gonna make a claim that 20% time is not a “nice to have” but a mandatory practice that all
companies should be following.</p>

<p>Before you go wailing about how this is entirely impractical and the product of pampered and spoiled employees,
I would like to redefine 20% a bit for my purposes to mean</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twenty percent of employee time spent on projects outside of their current mandate that relate
to company initiatives and goals, the technical platform’s stability and performance, or engineering
velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google’s 20% may follow rules such as this as well (not familiar enough with their process), but the basic
point is that the work should be <em>related</em> to the company in some way and not <em>entirely</em> personal projects
(although personal interest and motivation in a problem is necessary).</p>

<p>I should also clarify up front that the requirement (the <em>Mandatory</em> in the title of this post) is with the
company, not the employee. Meaning that it should be offered to, but not required of, the employee.</p>

<h1 id="the-normal-grind">The Normal Grind</h1>

<p>So this sounds nice and all, but why should this be mandatory? Well, let me know if any of the following
scenarios sound familiar to you.</p>

<p><strong>Product Rules</strong></p>

<p>The company is hyper-focused on delivering product as fast as possible. You are either in startup-mode and
attempting to be lean or possibly an enterprise going after large business opportunities. Either way, product
teams dominate and all of the engineering resources are dedicated to developing features as fast as possible.
As products are pushed out, technical-debt increases at a rapid pace, slowly taking more and more of a toll
on engineering velocity.</p>

<p><strong>Retro-Active Infrastructure Development</strong></p>

<p>For a variety of reasons (possibly due to a “Product Rules” scenario), the infrastructure that powers your
company is ignored. It was built long ago and has “worked” up till now, so no resources have been allocated
to maintain it. However one or more core / critical components are starting to buckle under the stress of the
organization (or already have) and now we must make fixes or we’re doomed. The company is now in emergency
mode that can be as severe as losing a client or going out of business if the issue cannot be fixed
in a timely manner.</p>

<p><strong>Wow That’s Old</strong></p>

<p>All of your work is built on top of <em>some</em> framework. That framework could either be something that was built
in-house or an open-source framework. Regardless, it’s old and out-dated. Don’t get me wrong, it still works and
functions as it should. However there is a lot of opportunities for productivity that are lost because the
framework has not been given the proper amount of attention in either continued development (in-house) or upgrading
to more recent versions (open-source). While this doesn’t have an immediate impact on <em>current</em> velocity, there
are certainly missed opportunities for productivity which gives your competition an opportunity to have a leg-up.</p>

<p><b>Internal Open <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Death</span> Source</b></p>

<p>At some point in the past a framework, library, or tool was developed. After it was created it was sent around
and the source was put up on some VCS server. The original writer doesn’t really have time to maintain it so he
“internally open sources” the project. Even though the project is oft used, no one touches the code, even if
there are issues because they don’t have time. Eventually a problem is encountered that cannot be worked around
and either the problem is fixed (yay) or as oft is the case, a new version that is <em>“sane”</em> is re-written and the
process starts all over again.</p>

<p><strong>The Wall</strong></p>

<p>Large companies often build software that is dependent upon other components / systems that are built by other
teams. When an issue is encountered it is simply thrown “over the wall”, meaning <em>to the team that owns the
system the bug is filed against</em>. However both teams have already planned their quarters and don’t really have
time to fix the issue. Months go by until eventually the team that filed the bug either lives with it or
escalates their product as being a “company priority”; re-prioritizing the owning team to fix the bug as part
of their <em>planned work</em> for the quarter.</p>

<h1 id="all-about-the-debt">All About the Debt</h1>

<p>I hear what you’re saying, “this is all just fancy ways of saying <em>‘technical debt’</em>.” Well, kind of, but there’s
more to it than that, technical debt is just a side-effect. It’s about your engineers not working collaboratively
or with shared goals. When engineers are expected to dedicate 100 percent of their time to company initiatives,
they don’t like to go out of their way to collaborate with other teams for fear that it could impact their own
deadlines. You can see silos developing as engineers become hyper-focused (or <em>“laser-focused”</em> if you prefer) and
engineers working without context of projects outside of their teams.</p>

<h1 id="the-improved-flow">The Improved Flow</h1>

<p>So all of this sounds bad, or typical depending on your perspective, but I think we can all agree that the above
is non-desirable for long-term sustainability of your technical platform. However I would expect that you’re also
skeptical if just <em>giving</em> your engineers 20% time really fixes any of this (and you should be skeptical, it’s 
healthy). And the answer to “will this really work?” is <em>kind of</em>. Simply introducing a 20% time and no structure
may not get you the results you desire. That’s not to say that <em>some</em> of the above can’t be achieved without structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal Open Source</strong> - Community managed projects are fret with small issues, feature requests, etc. that are
                           easily solvable with small amounts of time. Additionally knowledge of the
                           framework/library/etc can be built over time, allowing developers to tackle larger
                           improvements down the road.</li>
  <li><strong>The Wall</strong>             - More time to track down root-causes to issues and possibly propose fixes to systems
                           not “owned” by the engineer’s team (i.e. small-scale collaboration).</li>
  <li><em>Other Small Stuff</em>      - It’s easy for a single engineer to tackle small stuff on their own in relatively short
                           periods of time. Allowing your entire organization to follow the “boy scout rule” (leave
                           things nicer than you found them) can have a large impact over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, how do you handle the larger issues that exist? This takes coordination and planning. But how do you
bundle that in with 20% time? While there are likely many ways to approach this, I propose approaching it with
two strategies. Since I suck at naming I’ll call these two strategies Guilds and Working Groups since they function
in similar ways to what I have at my current employment. Let’s define them</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Guild</strong>         - Permanent group (members can change) with a specified subject-focus (e.g. metrics, performance,
                    analytics, etc).</li>
  <li><strong>Working Group</strong> - Ephemeral group formed for solving a pre-determined problem. Group disbands once the problem
                    has been solved / addressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If both of these strategies are meant to address larger issues, what is the difference? Let’s look at something like
metrics. Metrics is a problem with most tech organizations. Either we’re doing it wrong or there is much more that
can be gained. The Guild strategy is useful here as it creates a long-lasting organization to solve both the
current problems with metrics but to foster a culture of good metrics and push for continual improvement going
forward. The problem is never really solved and there is always room for improvement.</p>

<p>Now, what about upgrading that web-framework you’re using so you can support HTTP/2 and Web-Sockets? While this
may be a large task (lots of code to update) it has a very clear start and end. This is where the Working Group
strategy shines. A group can be formed with interested members who divvy up the work and make progress toward
a shared goal. A Working Group can take on small or large projects, as long as the end-goal is very clearly
defined.</p>

<p>There is also a relationship that exists between Guilds and Working Groups. While a Guild is focusing on the long-term,
it may still identify issues that would best be served by a Working Group. In this situation, the Guild can be
a facilitator to help organize (and possibly manage) Working Groups.</p>

<h1 id="sounds-like-a-lot">20% Sounds Like a Lot</h1>

<p>20% is just what Google does (or claims to do), not some magic value that will solve all your woes. Pick some
percentage or allotment of time that allows your engineers to work in the <strong>Improved Flow</strong>.</p>
