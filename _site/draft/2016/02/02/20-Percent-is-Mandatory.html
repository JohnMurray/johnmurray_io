    <article class="post-content">
        <p>We’re all familiar with Google’s <em>20%</em>. The developers’ dream of spending company time on personally
interesting projects. Every developer seems to desire this, but very few companies are truly offering
it. I’m gonna make a claim that 20% time is not a “nice to have” but a mandatory practice that all
companies should be following.</p>

<p>I would like to redefine 20% a bit for my purposes to means</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ten to twenty percent of employee time spent on projects outside of their current mandate that relate
to company initiatives and goals, the technical platform’s stability and performance, or engineering
velocity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google’s 20% may follow rules such as this as well (not familiar enough with their process), but the basic
point is that the work should be <em>related</em> to the company in some way and not <em>entirely</em> personal projects.</p>

<h1 id="the-normal-grind">The Normal Grind</h1>

<p>So this sounds nice and all, but why should this be mandatory? Well, let me know if any of the following
scenarios sound familiar to you.</p>

<p><strong>Product Rules</strong></p>

<p>The company is hyper-focused on delivering product as fast as possible. You are either in startup-mode and
attempting to be lean or possibly an enterprise going after large business opportunities. Either way, product
teams dominate and all resources are dedicated to developing features as fast as possible. As products are
pushed out, technical-debt increases at a rapid pace, slowly taking more and more of a toll on engineering
velocity.</p>

<p><strong>Retro-Active Infrastructure Development</strong></p>

<p>For a variety of reasons (possibly due to a “Product Rules” scenario), the infrastructure that powers your
company is ignored. It was built long ago and has “worked” up till now, so no resources have been allocated
to maintain it. However one or more core / critical components are starting to buckle under the stress of the
organization (or already have) and now we must make fixes or we’re doomed. The company is now in emergency
mode that can be anywhere as severe as losing a client or going out of business if the issue cannot be fixed
in a timely manner.</p>

<p><strong>Wow That’s Old</strong></p>

<p>All of your work is built on top of <em>some</em> framework. That framework could either be something that was built
in-house or an open-source framework. Regardless, it’s old and out-dated. Don’t get me wrong, it still works and
functions as it should. However there is a lot of opportunities for productivity that are lost because the
framework has not been given the proper amount of attention in either continued development (in-house) or upgrading
to more recent versions (open-source). While this doesn’t have an immediate impact on <em>current</em> velocity, there
are certainly missed opportunities for productivity which means your competition <em>could</em> have a leg-up on you.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Open Source</strong></p>

<p>At some point in the past a framework, library, or tool was developed. After it was created it was sent around
and the source was put up on some version control system server. The original writer doesn’t really have time to
maintain it so he “internally open sources” the project. Even though the project is used often, no one touches
the code, even if there are issues.</p>

<p><strong>The Wall</strong></p>

<p>Large companies often build software that is dependent upon other components / systems that are built by other
teams. When an issue is encountered it is simply thrown “over the wall”, meaning <em>to the team that owns the
system the bug is filed against</em>. However both teams have already planned their quarters and don’t really have
time to fix the issue. Months go by until eventually the team that filed the bug either lives with it or
escalates their product as being a “company priority”; re-prioritizing the owning team to fix the bug as part
of their <em>planned work</em> for the quarter.</p>
