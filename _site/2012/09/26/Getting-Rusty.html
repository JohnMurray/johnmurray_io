  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Have you heard of <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> (I’m not talking about iron oxide)? It’s a new
systems language being baked up by the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a>. Currently
it is very new and unstable (in the sense that it will change a LOT by the
time is reaches version 1). It looks very interesting and is well worth a look.</p>

<p>From my VERY limited knowledge of the language, it looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>,
and <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> had a child. However, I’m sure my opinion of this will change
greatly as I learn more about the language. All I can really say for sure is
that it looks like it’s going to be a great/fun language to learn. How could
it not with a feature list consisting of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-compiled (C/C++ compatible)</li>
  <li>static typing, with type inference</li>
  <li>simple concurrency model</li>
  <li>lambdas everywhere (the way it should be)</li>
  <li>immutable by default</li>
  <li>move semantics (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/can-someone-please-explain-move-semantics-to-me">good explanation here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="compiling">Compiling</h3>
<p>Okay, if we’re going to play around with the language then we’ll at least need
to compile it and get it up and running. For me, I had just setup a new Fedora
17 instance (no updates at this point) and to compile only required that I do:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3805064.js?file=compiling-rust.sh"></script>

<p>Do note that I use the <code>-j</code> option for <code>make</code> to speed things up on my
computer. I’d recommend to change the value of <code>-j</code> to however many cores your
computer has available. You might also need to run <code>make install</code> as sudo
if you do not have the necessary permissions. </p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="hello-rust">Hello Rust</h3>
<p>As is tradition, you have to force your newly compiled interpreter/compiler
to introduce itself to the world. And, in Rust, it’s just about as boring as it
is in any other language:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3805064.js?file=hello_world.rs"></script>

<p>A slightly more exciting example (shamelessly stolen from rust-lang.org’s
<a href="http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/0.3/tutorial.html#first-impressions">tutorial</a>), a parallel game of rock-paper-scissors:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3805064.js?file=parallel_rock_paper_scissors.rs">
</script>

<h3 id="i-want-more">I Want More!</h3>
<p>If you’re like me, then you think that Rust could really turn out to be something
fun and awesome (I really recommend heading on over to rust-lang.org to learn
something more substantial)! But, I’m not here to give a thorough walk-through
of the language. I’m more or less just giving a shout-out to what could really
be a very interesting systems-programming language.</p>
