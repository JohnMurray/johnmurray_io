<p>Right now I’m working at an interesting startup (<a href="http://mavizon.com">Mavizon</a>) and it can
be a lot of fun. The problems are interesting, the people are great, and
generally the atmosphere at work is enjoyable. </p>

<p>At Mavizon we have two offices; one in New Albany, IN and one in Alajuela, 
Costa Rica. Both offices have a similar arrangement of one open room where
everyone works and one meeting room where we do lots of video
conferencing. The Costa Rica office consists of programmers, a designer,
and a UX dev. The New Albany office has a couple of programmers, the
lead software architect, a couple of biz-devs, our scrum master, our “lawyer in
training,” and our founder. You can see that the New Albany office is quite
the mixed pot.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>So, what’s wrong with the picture that I have drawn for you? Remember to keep
in mind that Mavizon is a software house. If you need a hint, think about the 
by product of a room full of people… did you get it yet? </p>

<p>NOISE!</p>

<p>Lots and lots of noise! Whether it’s a YouTube video our biz-devs want to share,
our lawyer in training discussing patents and copyright with our CEO, or our scrum
leader giving feedback to our designer over the phone, it doesn’t matter. It
all comes down to a lot of noise. Yes, a lot of the noise is generated from 
conversations pertinent to day-to-day operations but, a fair amount is also just
normal conversations that everyone is forced to listen to. </p>

<p>If you’re a programmer, then you know this is not good. Programming is hard
(<em>good</em> programming at least) and requires concentration. To get to that level
of concentration, you need some level of silence. Any break in concentration
can immediately nullify your current mental progress. </p>

<p>If you’re not a programmer and you don’t really understand why this is the
case, then let me give you an example. Let’s say that your sole job is to
build card-houses (cute little houses made from a deck of playing cards). You
count progress by the number of houses that you can build in a day. These
things are pretty tough to build so let’s say on a good day you can build two
or three. If you have a nice indoor space, plenty of table-space, and a pile
of cards then you should be on your way to building two or three card-houses
each day. However, what if you had to build these outside? When you are done
then you can bring them inside to store. This may be all fine and dandy
at first, but the first windy day is going to give you a lot of problems. Each
time the wind gusts it may knockdown part, or all, of your card-house. You can
quickly see that you are no longer in control of your productivity. When you
were inside, let’s say you knew you could get 2.7 card-houses built per day on 
average. Now that you’re outside, you’re
somewhat at the mercy of the wind. On a bad day, you may not build any 
card-houses and on the best days, you’ll do as good as you did inside 
(but you’ll never do any better).</p>

<p>It is sad when the business cannot recognize this because they are decreasing
the productivity of their programmers, incurring a significantly higher cost
to build software products. If a company wants to be lean and efficient, then
it needs to work hard at creating productive work environments for <em>all</em> of its
employees (i.e. Not everyone works great in a quiet work environment, I’m only
speaking from the perspective of a programmer.).</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>I want to address the idea that open spaces encourage collaboration. In my
personal experience (at this position and my prior), I find that the talk
consist of about 5-10% collaboration and 90-95% interruptions un-important
to the day-to-day operations. </p>

<p>If you want an open space, then you need to set time aside to work in silence
or have separate “quiet areas” where no talking is allowed for when you need
to get stuff done.</p>
