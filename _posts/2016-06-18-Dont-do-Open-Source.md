I know... the title is a little provocative, and partially a lie. But hey, you're here,
so you might as well read what I have to say.

## I don't do open source

I've always felt this cultural push to do and work on open source projects. It's the
way to achieve programmer greatness. The way you prove your chops as a great programmer
to the rest of the world. It's stupid.

I'm not saying open source isn't great (it's fantastic) and I'm not saying that you shouldn't
contribute. I'm just saying that it's not personally for me. And I'm honestly a little
tired of the industry notion that great programmers all contribute to open source. Obviously
not everyone holds these beliefs, but I've seen enough job postings (from recruiters and sites
like Indeed to engineers posting jobs in chat rooms and Hacker News) to see that this _is_
a trend.

## My GitHub is full of unfinished projects

My GitHub account is not a place where "real" software lives. It's a place where I express ideas,
tinker with shiny new toys, and experiment. Some projects have README's that detail the intent; some
projects work while others don't even compile or run.

Whenever I have a new thing I want to try out or a new idea that I want to try and express, I'll usually
create a GitHub repository to host it. It may not lead to anything, but that is not the point.

## I like it this way

For a while now I've been attempting to merge the concepts of exploration and experimentation with open
source. My primary motivation being to build a "portfolio" of work that demonstrates my abilities. But
this inevitably led me to burn out time after time. When I burn out I get depressed, watch a bunch of 
TV, and spend way to much time playing video games.

I realized that my experiments are not open source projects (in the traditional sense) and that
open source is probably not for me, at least not right now. Each person needs to find what they
really enjoy and stick with it. For me that means learning through experimentation and small
toy projects. And when an idea grabs my attention, I need to follow it.

This likely means I'll stop working on "projects" mid-way though, when all the interesting bits seem
answered. It also means jumping from idea to idea, depending on my mood or what I find most interesting.
These are not bad things, because these are the things that keep me motivated, keep me learning. 

# Because something is better than nothing

Even if this attitude of "to be a good programmer you must of open source" continues/grows, I'm
still better off doing what keeps me motivated, happy, and continually learning.
