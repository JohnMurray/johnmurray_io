### Premise
Go is great. Scala is great. Scala has `Try`s. Go doesn't.

### Motivation
I'm a horrible person. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Horribleness
In Go it's typical to return `error`s as soon as they happen and handle them locally, or
wrap them with some additional context and pass them back up the stack. In Scala however it's
idiomatic to wrap an error into a `Try` which represents _either_ a successfully computed value
or an error. The advantage of a `Try` over a 2-tuple (or multiple return-values) is that the
`Try` can be composed so that you can chain functions together and worry if they failed later,
allowing the error to cascade. An example in Scala might look like:

{% highlight scala %}
def configLoad()                   : Try[String]         = ???
def getDbConnection(s: String)     : Try[sql.Connection] = ???
def queryForData(c: sql.Connection): Try[sql.Result]     = ???
def transformResults(r: sql.Result): Try[app.MyModel]    = ???

val model: Try[app.MyModel] =
  for {
    s <- configLoad()
    c <- getDbConnection(s)
    r <- queryForData(c)
    m <- transformResults(r)
  } yield (m)
{% endhighlight %}

Look how readable that is! _Wow...._

Above are several functions, meant to be called in order. Each function returns a possible
error and the next function takes the success value of the previous function. The code starting
with `for {` is some syntactic sugar (mmmmmm sugar) that allows us to call `map` and `flatMap`
which are essentially ways of calling the next function assuming the previous one succeeded.
If there was an error, then the value of `model` will be a failed `Try` (`Failure` in Scala)
with the error.

This allows the programmer to write code that describes the "happy path", dealing with errors
at the last possible moment (just like real life).  Some would argue this style is more
readable (if at least not more relatable). ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

To be fair, this programming style has it's own
pattern named after trains and if that isn't enough to convince you, then I think there are larger
issues at play. Go read this two-part post, it's super good so you should read it without me
prompting you anyways: [part-1][rop_part_1], [part-2][rop_part_2].

I don't want this to turn into an in-depth explanation of `Try` in Scala, so go read the
[docs here][scala_try] if you still want to know more.

### Continued Horribleness

Let's make a `Try` in Go.

Since we don't have generics let's (for now) just use `interface {}` as the value contained
within our Try.

{% highlight go %}
type Try struct {
    success bool
    value   interface{}
    err     error
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty self-explanatory. Also note that `success` is used instead of checking for `nil` on
`success` or `err` because it's more explicit'ish.

Next a utility function.

{% highlight go %}
func ToTry(value interface{}, err error) *Try {
    return &Try{
        success: err == nil,
        value:   value,
        err:     err,
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can wrap other functions that produce value/err results. Such as:

{% highlight go %}
func doSomething() (string, error) {
    if someCheck() {
        return "biscuits", nil
    }
    return "", errors.New("You failed the all-important check")
}

func main() {
    var result Try = ToTry(doSomething())

    // use result as Try
}
{% endhighlight %}

So we got a basic container, but that's more or less useless. Especially given that there
are no publicly exported fields in our struct and no functions except our utility function
to create/use the `Try`. Let's define some basic functions for creating and interacting with
`Try`:

{% highlight go %}
// NewSuccess creates a new succeeded Try
func NewSuccess(value interface{}) *Try {
    return &Try{
        success: true,
        value:   value,
        err:     nil,
    }
}

func NewFailure(err error) *Try {
    return &Try{
        success: false,
        value:   nil,
        err:     err,
    }
}

func (t *Try) IsSuccess() bool {
    return t.success
}

func (t *Try) IsFailure() bool {
    return !t.success
}

func (t *Try) GetValue() interface{} {
    if t.IsFailure() {
        panic("you do not know what you are doing") // totally right thing to do
    }
    return t.value
}

func (t *Try) GetFailure() error {
    if t.IsSuccess() {
        panic("you do not know what you are doing") // totally right thing to do
    }
    return t.err
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is good, but not entirely usable. As it stands this is just as _wonderful_ as the
existing Go model of checking errors right at the source. We need some way for the errors
to cascade and for us to say what we _want_ to do without having to worry about so much
error handling. For this we have to break out the big guns (pew pew), `map` and `flatMap`.
If you haven't heard of these functions yet, maybe go try googling "higher order functions"
to get a better idea. I'll avoid explaining them here since that could be a whole other post
on it's own.

Let's take a stab at this:
{% highlight go %}
func (t *Try) Map(f func(interface{}) interface{}) *Try {
    if !t.success {
        return t
    }
    return &Try{
        success: true,
        value:   f(t.value),
        err:     nil,
    }
}

func (t *Try) FlatMap(f func(interface{}) *Try) *Try {
    if !t.success {
        return t
    }
    return f(t.value)
}

func (t *Try) FlatMapWrap(f func(interface{}) (interface{}, error)) *Try {
    if !t.success {
        return t
    }
    return ToTry(f(t.value))
}
{% endhighlight %}

So now with this, we can attempt to chain some stuff together, with all the wonderfulness
that is working with `interface {}` which is obviously the superior way of writing code in
Go:

{% highlight go %}
func test()          (string, error) { return "", nil }
func test2(s string) (int, error)    { return 128, nil }
func test3(i int)    *Try            { return NewSuccess(true) }
func test4(b bool) string {
    if b {
        return "true"
    }
    return "false"
}

func main() {
    ToTry(test()).FlatMapWrap(func(s interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
        return test2(s.(string))
    }).FlatMap(func(i interface{}) *Try {
        return test3(i.(int))
    }).Map(func(b interface{}) interface{} {
        return test4(b.(bool))
    })
}
{% endhighlight %}

I mean, can you not see the benefit of this yet? Who would not choose this highly readable, soooper
maintainable code over immediate error checking? It's always best to avoid your problems as long
as possible ([LPT][reddit_lpt]).

### Less Horrible?

Even though so far we have a working `Try` complete with `interface {}` everywhere (a favorite
style of _"real programmers"_), the benevolent overlords of Go built us [`go generate`][go_generate]
and it would be a shame to not find a way to shove that into this blog post.

Thanks to [genny][github_genny], onwards and upwards my friends!

First a template without any of the transformation functions (`Map`, `FlatMap`, etc):

{% highlight go %}
package try

import (
	"github.com/cheekybits/genny/generic"
)

type Type generic.Type

type TypeTry struct {
	success bool
	value   Type
	err     error
}

func ToTypeTry(value Type, err error) *TypeTry {
	return &TypeTry{
		success: err == nil,
		value:   value,
		err:     err,
	}
}

func NewTypeSuccess(value Type) *TypeTry {
	return &TypeTry{
		success: true,
		value:   value,
		err:     nil,
	}
}

func NewTypeFailure(err error) *TypeTry {
	return &TypeTry{
		success: false,
		err:     err,
	}
}

func (t *TypeTry) IsSuccess() bool {
	return t.success
}

func (t *TypeTry) IsFailure() bool {
	return !t.success
}

func (t *TypeTry) GetValue() Type {
	if t.IsFailure() {
		panic("you do not know what you are doing")
	}
	return t.value
}

func (t *TypeTry) GetFailure() error {
	if t.IsSuccess() {
		panic("you do not know what you are doing")
	}
	return t.err
}
{% endhighlight %}

With this + `genny`, we can generate some basic `Try` code for a specific type without any composition
functions (we'll get there). To get the basic support we'd simply run:

{% highlight bash %}
# inside the root of your project
mkdir -p try
genny -in try_base.go.tmp -out try/int_base.go gen "Type=int"
{% endhighlight %}

And you can now write code like:

{% highlight go %}
var it IntTry = NewIntSuccess(5)
if it.IsSuccess() {
    fmt.Println(it.GetValue())
}
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, without being able to compose things with `Try`s of other types, this isn't that great. So let's
make a template that allows us to map from one type to another:

{% highlight go %}
package try

import (
	"github.com/cheekybits/genny/generic"
)

type FromType = generic.Type
type ToType = generic.Type

func (t *FromTypeTry) MapToToType(f func(FromType) ToType) *ToTypeTry {
	if !t.success {
		return &ToTypeTry{
			success: false,
			err:     t.err,
		}
	}
	return &ToTypeTry{
		success: true,
		value:   f(t.value),
		err:     nil,
	}
}

func (t *FromTypeTry) FlatMapToToType(f func(FromType) *ToTypeTry) *ToTypeTry {
	if !t.success {
		return &ToTypeTry{
			success: false,
			err:     t.err,
		}
	}
	return f(t.value)
}

func (t *FromTypeTry) FlatMapWrapToToType(f func(FromType) (ToType, error)) *ToTypeTry {
	if !t.success {
		return &ToTypeTry{
			success: false,
			err: t.err,
		}
	}
	return ToToTypeTry(f(t.value))
}
{% endhighlight %}

With this I can replace our original `genny` command with these two:

{% highlight bash %}
genny -in try_base.go.tmp    -out try/try_base.go    gen "Type=string,int"
genny -in try_compose.go.tmp -out try/try_compose.go gen "FromType=string,int ToType=string,int"
{% endhighlight %}

And now I have two `Try` types, `IntTry` and `StringTry` and can seamlessly convert back and forth
like so:

{% highlight go %}
func main() {
	composedValue := try.NewStringSuccess("37").
		FlatMapWrapToInt(strconv.Atoi).
		MapToString(func(i int) string {
			return fmt.Sprintf("Parsed to: %d", i)
		})

	if composedValue.IsSuccess() {
		fmt.Println(composedValue.GetValue())
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Conclusion

\o/ Yay! This is all very horrible, but it actually works in a usable way. Feel free to spread the _love_ ;-)
