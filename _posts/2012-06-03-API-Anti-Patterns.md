There's a lot we can learn from Microsoft, some of it from well designed
software and <s>most</s> some of it from poorly designed software. 
This particular post is about the latter. 

I was working in .NET today (yes, it was a sad day) and I needed to do the
following:

- Serialize an object to valid JSON
- Send that JSON to a HTTP service via an HTTP POST
- Verify the response (200 status code)

Sounds fairly simple. In Ruby, it looks something like this:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
uri = URI.parse('http://localhost:4567')
Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port) do |http|
  headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
  http.post2('/service_path', data.to_json, headers) do |resp|
    return resp.code == '200'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

I would expect the .NET version to be fairly similar (but longer of course).
However, I was a little off in my assumptions. Let me walk you through the
steps I took just to get the same functionality in the Ruby code above. As
we go along, I'll point out the anti-patterns found in the .NET standard lib.

#### Step 1 - Defining a Data Contract
{% highlight c# linenos %}
[DataContract]
public class MyObjectDataContract
{
    [DataMember(Name = "user_id")]
    public int? UserId { get; set; }
 
    [DataMember(Name = "car_id")]
    public int? CarId { get; set; }
 
    [DataMember(Name = "template_data")]
    public Dictionary<String, object> TemplateData { get; set; }
 
    [DataMember(Name = "key")]
    public Dictionary<String, object> Key { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}
Nothing out of the ordinary here. Everything seems to be going well so far. I've
defined my basic object that I would like to serialize to JSON and life is
peachy.

#### Step 2 - Serialize the JSON
Based on what I found on the internet, this should suffice:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
// assume myObjectDataContract is already set and defined
 
MemoryStream jsonStream = new MemoryStream();
DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer(
    typeof(MyObjectDataContract));
ser.WriteObject(jsonStream, myObjectDataContract);
{% endhighlight %}

___Anit-Pattern #1___ - Organize your standard library in a way that makes no
logical sense

I had to include the _System.XML_ DLL into my project
for this to work for searializing to JSON?? (VS reported the error on line 6
in the example above.) This is an aweful orginization of the standard lib. Why
do I need to include _System.XML_ in order to use the JSON serializer?!?!?

<br />
_Deep breath... Okay, let's continue._

<br />

I used built-in data structures so that the serialization would/should work
properly. After all, they are part of the standard lib! So, I would expect the
serialized JSON of my data contract to look like:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "car_id": 2,
  "template_data": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": "value3"
  },
  "key": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<br />

___Anti-Patern #2___ - Write code that doesn't follow standards or user-expectations

Nope, instead the JSON comes out looking like this:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "car_id": 2,
  "template_data": [
    {"Key": "key1", "Value": "value1"},
    {"Key": "key2", "Value": "value2"},
    {"Key": "key3", "Value": "value3"}
  ],
  "key": [
    {"Key": "key1", "Value": "value1"},
    {"Key": "key2", "Value": "value2"}
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

WHAT THE HECK! Who in the world would think a key-value data-structure would
translate to an array where each key-value pair is it's own object!? If that
makes any sense to you then, please, explain it to me. 

<br />

___Anti-Pattern #3___ - Provide an alternative method that provides the correct
functionality, give it a confusing name, and package it with a huge library so
that if you only need that one class then you're screwed. 

Come to find out, there is a correct implementation of a JSON serializer that is
called _JavaScriptSerializer_ that lives in the System.Web DLL. Okay, if it's
not confusing already that Microsoft is drawing a distinction between JSON and
JavaScript serialization, they make sure that if you want proper JSON 
serialization you have to include the _entire_ System.Web DLL. Seriously!?

I'm just working on a simple utility project that will assist other
systems in our infrastructure. This project will be utilized by a variety
of project types. I can't, in good conscience, force every project for carry
around a dependency of System.Web. So, off to the interwebs I go to find
another solution. 

<br />
...

<br />

Okay, I'm back and I have a solution!
I'm going to rewrite the entire application in Ruby! Yep... That should do
the trick. 

<br />

___Anti-Pattern #4___ - Make fixing your dumb mistakes require a lot of
boiler-plate code that clutters up the user's code-base.

Ah, if only it were that simple. What I really found on the webs
was how to write a wrapper-class to the built-in Dictionary class that would
serialize correctly. 

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
[Serializable]
public class JsonDictionary<K, V> : ISerializable
{
    Dictionary<K, V> dict = new Dictionary<K, V>();
 
    public JsonDictionary() { } 
 
    protected JsonDictionary(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {   
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }   
 
    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {   
        foreach (K key in dict.Keys)
        {   
            info.AddValue(key.ToString(), dict[key]);
        }   
    }   
 
    public void Add(K key, V value)
    {   
        dict.Add(key, value);
    }   
 
    public V this[K index]
    {   
        set { dict[index] = value; }
        get { return dict[index]; }
    }   
}
{% endhighlight %}

This class just uses a Dictionary as the underlying data-store and serializes
correctly. The downside is that it really hides a lot of functionality that
is given by the built-in Dictionary type. One really useful feature it is
missing is the collections-constructor:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
var dict = new Dictionary<String, Int32>
{
    {"one",   1 },
    {"two",   2 },
    {"three", 3 },
    // ...
    {"ten",   10}
};
{% endhighlight %}

Well, I just can't do without those nicities. That's an easy fix though, I
just need to be able to call a method, such as _ToJson()_, on a Dictionary
object.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
public static class IDictionaryExtension
{
    public static JsonDictionary<K, V> ToJsonDictionary<K,V>(this IDictionary<K, V> dict)
    {   
        if (dict == null)
            return null;
        var jsonDict = new JsonDictionary<K, V>();
        foreach (var key in dict.Keys)
        {   
            jsonDict[key] = dict[key];
        }   
        return jsonDict;
    }                                                                                                                                                                            
}
{% endhighlight %}

There we go, now I can just call _ToJsonDictionary()_ on any IDictionary
object right before serializing to JSON. Finally, we have working serialization!

#### Step 3 - Send JSON via HTTP POST

In terms of length and complexity, sending a request isn't too cumbersome of a 
process. Assuming that we have already serialized the JSON into a Stream
object, sending our request looks like the following:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(NSUrl);
request.Method = "POST";
request.ContentLength = jsonStream.Length;
request.ContentType = "application/json";
Stream requestStream = request.GetRequestStream();
requestStream.Write(jsonStream.ToArray(), 0, (int)jsonStream.Length);
requestStream.Close();
{% endhighlight %}

If we look back at the Ruby example above, you'll notice that almost all of the
code is focusing on sending the request. So, as far as sending web-requests is
concerned, the .NET version is comparable in terms of length. 

However, one thing to think aboutâ€”when is the request sent? Well, in this case,
it wasn't. Yep, you read correctly, the request in the above example was never
made. You might say, _"Of course it never sent, you obviously have to call some
type of Send() method or something similar."_ Well, that would be the
_sensible_ thing to do now wouldn't it.

<br />

___Anti-Pattern #5___ - Implicit is better than explicit (especially when it
is non-obvious)

The request is sent when you ask for the response. Yes, that does make sense
if I am interested in the response. However, if I just want to "send and
forget" then you would use the following to make the request:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
// Build up request
// ...
 
// Send request
request.GetResponse();
{% endhighlight %}

Sure... that's real intuitive. 


#### Step 4 - Verify the response status code

Finally! We've made sense of the .NET framework (oxymoron?) and can finally
verify the reponse status code. This part is so simple, it'd be a real challenge
to screw this one up. It is simply:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
var statusCode = response.StatusCode;
 
return statusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK;
{% endhighlight %}

Holy crap Microsoft...
